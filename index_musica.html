            Have you got colour in your cheeks?
            Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
            The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
            Are there some aces up your sleeve?
            Have you no idea that you're in deep?
            I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
            
            How many secrets can you keep?
            'Cause there's this tune I found
            That makes me think of you somehow
            And I play it on repeat
            Until I fall asleep
            Spilling drinks on my settee
            
            (Do I wanna know)
            If this feeling flows both ways?
            (Sad to see you go)
            Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
            (Baby, we both know)
            That the nights were mainly made
            For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
            
            Crawling back to you
            Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
            'Cause I always do
            Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
            Now, I've thought it through
            Crawling back to you
            
            So, have you got the guts?
            Been wondering if your heart's still open
            And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
            Simmer down and pucker up
            I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
            Of trying to kiss you
            I don't know if you feel the same as I do
            But we could be together if you wanted to
            
            (Do I wanna know)
            If this feeling flows both ways?
            (Sad to see you go)
            Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
            (Baby, we both know)
            That the nights were mainly made
            For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
            
            Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)
            Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (You've had a few?)
            'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
            Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)
            Busy being yours (being yours)
            To fall for somebody new
            Now, I've thought it through
            Crawling back to you
            
            (Do I wanna know)
            If this feeling flows both ways?
            (Sad to see you go)
            Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

            (Do I wanna know?)
            Too busy being yours to fall
            (Sad to see you go)
            Ever thought of calling, darling?
            (Do I wanna know?)
            Do you want me crawling back to you?
